# BreastCancerDetection
Breast cancer, the most common cancer among women worldwide accounting for 25 percent of all cancer cases and affected 2.1 million people in 2015. The early diagnosis of cancer significantly increases the chances of survival.
The key challenge in cancer detection is how to classify tumors into malignant or benign machine learning techniques can dramatically improves the accuracy of diagnosis
Research indicates that most experienced physicians can diagnose cancer with 79 percent accuracy while 91 percent correct diagnosis is achieved using machine learning techniques.

Here, the task was to classify tumors into malignant or benign tumors using features like appearance, size, shape and texture from several cell images. This was done using 3 models, namely Logistic regression, decision tree classifier and random forest classifier with a safe accuracy of 0.95.
